IN linux there are different packaging standards and different package managers exists specific to the distros why ? 

Anything that comes out of kernel becomes common across all the distros. Unfortunately the kernel has not defined any packaging standard
or package managers to install/run a software application.

The developer/end user has to manually perform all the operations inorder to use/run the software application directly on the linux kernel. This may not makes linux user friendly operating system..


The linux distros identified the gap and introduces with their own packageing standard and package managers for faciliating the installation of the software packages on their distros..


Ubuntu 
	Packaging standard == .deb
	Package managers ==> apt and dpkg
	
Redhat 
	Packaging standard ==> .rpm
	package managers ==> yum and rpm
	
Why there are two tools ? 
	One for downloading and installing the software from software repositories.
	
	
There are 4 types of software repositories provided by the distro
Ubuntu/RedHat/Slackware/Arc

1.Main  - Cananical and OpenSource Software Distributions [Ubuntu Software Packages]
2.Universal : Communnity Driven Software packages and open source.
3.Restricted: Device Drivers of specific device softwares.
4.Multiverse: Restricted and licenced softwares.
