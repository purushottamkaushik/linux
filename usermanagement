User Management :
	Linux is a multi-user operating system, multiple users can login and access the system resources at tthe same time.
	
	
	In linux we have two type of the users :
		1. ROOT user
		2. Normal User
	
	ROOT User : There can be only one root user of a linux install . He has control of the entire system resources
		1.1 Create other users.
		1.2 MOdify other users.
		can manaaged any files onthe device
		can manage process
		User management
		File Management
		Network COnfigurations
		System Configurations
		
		
	*****************NEVER loose the root user of the linux if so you lost the access to the system 
		
		
	2. Normal User : Other than the one ROOT user any user we add into  linux system becomes the normal user
	 	the normal user can only see his/her files under the user home directory but cannot have access to any system resources
	 			
		Any user added by the root user is known as Normal User.
		
	Groups : User in linux can't be managed individually as it takes lot of time in tracking which user has access to what and issuing permission individually also take lot of time.
	
	 That is why linux comes with groups. We can create groups and can associate users to groups so that collectively we can manage those group of users by granting permissions/revoking to the group.
	 
	 
	 
	What are the basic attributes of a user ? 
		 
	 JOE 
	    - file 	== associate this file to that user internally 
	    For eery resource in lniux it is assocated with the user who created it.
	    
	    File
	    	Attributes 
	    	   Owner ==> JOE
	    	   
	** Every user we create in linux is identified by Uid of the user
		10 Files 
			-Attributes 
			Owner - 1001
		
		
It means every users we have attributes like : 
	1. username
	2. uid
	3. password
	4. groupId (For every group also we have gid(GroupId) through which a group is identifued)
	
/directory = permission to group 1011

How to add a user into linux system ?
The user is added to the linux system by creating a USER ACCOUNT .
*** While adding a user linux will create a uid for the user based on the sequence increment from last uid (currentUID = previous UId  + 1 ). (Automatically)

JOE ==USERNAME

JOE_GROUP 

2 Every user must and should associate to a group in linux , so when we add a user linux will automatically create a group with the usersname and associate the user to this group .

3. For every user account being added to default username directory will be created and associated for that users

4. and stores all the information about the user in a file called /etc/passwd
==========================================================================================


How to see how many users are there in the linux system ?

cat /etc/passwd 

Command to add user ==> useradd username

			 useradd -u uid -g gid -d /home/directory -s shell 
			 

sudo su - = will switch the user into root prompt. 
By default the terminal will not be opened with root priviledges to prottected accidental damage to the system resources. 

useradd username ==> By default it will create a user which has password (Empty) ===========> Standard bash command 
***** Before performing the useradd you must enter using root user access using command (sudo su -)


useradd ==> Standard bash command
======================================================================================================

Add user to system

adduser username




root@ubuntuDevops:/home/joe# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

adduser joe

root@ubuntuDevops:/home/joe# id joe
uid=1001(joe) gid=1001(joe) groups=1001(joe)
root@ubuntuDevops:/home/joe#


======================================================================
How to switch the user ? 

SUDO ==> Switch user DO
su ==> Switch user 

sudo su username
	sudo su joe
	sudo su anup
	
FOr all commands in /sbin directory can be accessed in super user of the linux system only. 
By default terminal logs in user in normal mode. In order to execute any of the /sbin commmands we need to switch as root.

Instead of switching everytime we can use sudo (DO It as superuser) and will not switch the current user.

Root user can only switch the user..

	
sbin commands (These commands can be executed by super user of the linux system)
	adduser
	groupadd
	su 
	userdel
	chown 
	chgrp
	systemctl 
	
	
When we open linux terminal by default it asks for username/password and login as a normal user into the prompt [ even we supply super user credentials for protection/safety]
	
As there are multiple user in the linux system we can swithc from one to another user without restarting.
This will logout the current user and login with the new user.

Syntax :-> su user ,but su is a /sbin command and can be run by super user only. so inorder to run as superuser priviledge we have two options 
	1. Switch as root
	2. sudo command
	
SUDO Stands for super user do. ==> EXCEUTE THE COMMAND WIITH ROOT USER PRIVELEDGES
THEN after successful authentication as root user you will be switched to joe>

note : SUDO CANNOt be used by all users.

===============================================

ROOT = ONLY one user as a root can manaage linux system ?


sudoers ==> 
	We can nominate few normal users as sudoers without compromising the security.
	
	
Sudoers can do only this: software installations, process management , resource management.

How to promote Normal User as sudoers?
 /etc/sudoers in this you can add normal users to add as sudoers 
 
There are 2 ways to do this
	sudoers  
 		username
 			joe
 			demo	
 
 		group
 			hr 
 		
 
1. add joe to sudoers file 
2. assign joe to sudoers group


sudo su - or sudo su root

==============================================

How to add groups ?

groupadd groupName

groupadd -gid 1002 groupName

Want to see a user in which groups ?

groups username ==> shows a user is in which groups

I want to see the details of a user ? (id username) =shows the information of a user

passwd = is to reset the current system password of the user after login.

groupdel groupName ==> To delete a group 
==============================================

How to modify a user ? 

adduser rock

usermod -aG sudoers rock # add user rock to sudoers group
============================================

userdel 



=============================================

Command 'userid' not found, did you mean:

  command 'uservd' from deb userv (1.2.0)

Try: apt install <deb name>
