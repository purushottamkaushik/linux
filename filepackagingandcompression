File packaging and compression

packaging == we can package multiple files of a directory into one single file by using packaging. Packaging doesnt compress the contents file/folder.

 The only purpose of packaging is to make one single file so that it can be easily distributed 


Linux has provided one utiility called "tar" stands for tarball.

tar -cvf books.tar books

-c = create
-v = verbose 
-f = filename

always the tar file has the extension ".tar" 

how to untar the files ? 
tar -xvf books.tar

-x = extract 
-v = verbose
-f = input filename

tar -xvf books.tar -C directory ==> untar the file into specified directory.

-C for specifying the directory


====================================================================================


packaging = tar -cvf target.tar sourcedirectory

unpack = tar -xvf target.tar 

unpack to a diffrenetn directory = tar -xvf  target.tar -C directory

compression = The group of files of a folder cannot be compressed directly unless those are packaged into a single tar file ..

Linux has provided a software utility "gzip and gunzip"

gzip == compression ( size is reduced and easily transfer it easily over the network)
 
gunzip ==> uncompression (size is expanded) 

==========================================================================


target.tar  ==> gzip target.tar ==> It created the target.tar.gz with the zipped contents in the same directory,now here you wont find .tar file 
".gz" ==> indicated its an linux zip extension

gunzip target.tar.gz ===> this will unzip the .gz into .tar back
