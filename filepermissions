Files and Folder permissions

1.Linux is an multi user operating system where various different users can parrallely use the machine and underlying resources.
2.It is the basic requirement of the linux to built-up some security features in handling and protecting the underlying 
resources of the users when multiple users are using the machine.
3. One of such system resources the users will use in linux is files and folders.
4. A file or folder that has been created by a user should be protected to be accessed/modified by any other user of the linux system.
5. This can be achieved by using files and folders permissions provided by linux.


Along with enforcing securitty, we want to have controlled sharablity of the resources to effectively use the linux system and resources.


Why a user can appear in multiple groups?

It is east to manage permissions for the resources of the system at group level rather than individual
But it would again become difficult in manageing permissions for multiple groups.

Rather we can associate a user to a group and can grant permissions to that group only,
if a change is required like more users or less users we can manage only that group.

BY looking at above methodology we can understand a user need to be in multiple groups
to have access to several different resources of the machine.

***A linux user who is not owner of the files, who doesnt belong to any group is known as other*****


===============================================================================

Files and Folder permission
Linux has come up with 3 levels of managing the file permission:
1. owner = creater of the file / folder 
2. Group = the group to which the file belongs , those user permissions.
3. Other = the user who is not a owner and doesnt belong to the file group is called others.


Permissions
1. read
2. write
3. execute

touch story.txt = linux will assign default permissions for a file/folder internally.
