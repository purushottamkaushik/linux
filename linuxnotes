Pipes and Redirections 

Pipe (|) is used to joining two linux shell commands and execute together 

command1 | command2 


redirection ( < And  > ) 

Its is used for writing or redirecting the output to another destination or take input from a different location

< , > symbols are used for redirection the output or taking the input

command  > destination (only destination not command allowed) 


file1.txt
This is devops
Linux is prerequistics for Devops


cat file1.txt | wc -l # Piping operation 

ls -l | wc -l 

who | wc -l 

ps -ef # Full Process List 


ps -ef | wc -l # TO list all processes 

ps -ef | grep "firefox"

ps ==> Show processes

-e for everyone
-f full listing

How many number of processes are running by sriman


cat Hello.txt | grep -wo "Demo" | wc -l


=======================================================================

ls -l | grep -iw "JAN 24" # To check files created on JAN 24


pipes : used for joining two commands. The output of the first command will be passed as the input of the second command
and will execute. In this way we can join any no of commands and would get executred from left to right

redirections : are used to redirecting the standard input oor output of a command

There are 2 type of redirections are there .
1. <= input redirection
2. > output redirection

Usually a command writes the output onto the standard cosnile if you want to write the outpit of a command to a differrent desitnation 

Similarly a command task the input from standard input , but if you want to pass any other source as an input than standard input , then use input redirection "<"

note:- redirections cannot be used between 2 commands.
